      <p className="py-6">Celebrations bring people together, promote well-being, give a sense of tradition and <br /> help us to remember the things in life that truly matter. <br />
       Birthday celebrations allow us to acknowledge those in our <br /> lives who are important to us and celebrate the gift of their lives.
We believe every child deserves to feel special and celebrated on their <br />
 birthday. Our mission is to bring joy to the lives of children and families facing adverse circumstances through the celebration of birthdays, holidays, and other special life events. <br /> We deliver birthday party packs that include all the decorations, supplies and goodies needed to throw a simple yet meaningful birthday party, as well as a new gift for the birthday child. Children are referred to <br /> our program through local shelters, social workers and agencies. </p>
